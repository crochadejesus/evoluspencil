###Diagram Drawing Support###
Pencil now supports connectors which can be used to "wire" shapes together in a diagram. A collection of flowchart shapes are also available for drawing diagrams.


###Exporting to Different Output Formats###
Pencil supports outputing the drawing document into different types of formats. You can have your drawing exported as a set of rasterized PNG files or as a web page that can be delivered to the viewers.

Pencil also supports exporting documents into popular formats including OpenOffice/LibreOffice text documents, Inkscape SVG and Adobe PDF.


###Easily Find Cliparts from the Internet###

Pencil has a clipart browser tool that integrates with [OpenClipart.org](https://openclipart.org/) to let users easily find cliparts by keywords and added them into the drawing by a simple drag-and-drop operation.

Clipart listed by the tool are in vector format and hence good for users in scaling to appropriate sizes.


###Inter-page linking###
Elements in a drawing can be linked to a specific page in the same document. This helps user define the UI flow when creating application or website mockups.

Linkings defined in a document are converted into HTML hyper-links when the document is exported into web format. This process creates an interactive version of the mockup in which viewers can see a simulated flow when clicking on the UI elements.
